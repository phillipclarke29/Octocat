Explain what a branch is, in your own words

A branch is an independent line of code development for a feature or new function.

The branch represents a fork in the project which results in a line of code development.

You can list all the branches in your repo with

Git branch

It is important to remember that when you create a new branch with 

git branch <branchname> 

you do not checkout that branch

You can use

git checkout -b <new branch>

to create and checkout a new branch at the same time

To switch branches use

git checkout <branch>

To delete a branch use 

git branch -d <branch>

which will warn you a branch has not been merged, and

git branch -D <branch> 

which overrides the warning
